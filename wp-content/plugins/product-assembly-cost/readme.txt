Add an option to your WooCommerce products to enable assembly service and optionally charge a fee.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add an option to your WooCommerce products to enable assembly service and optionally charge a fee.

In WooCommerce > Settings > Products you can set up the default assembly status and cost, the message and the way the costs are shown on the cart.

If the customer chooses to add the assembly service, that information is shown in the cart and orders. The assembly cost can be added to the cart as a global fee, instead of at the product level, to avoid discount plugins to also affect the assembly cost.
